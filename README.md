# IntershipJohnDeere

This project refers to the internship at John Deere. The goal was to create a dashboard for the daughter company Kemper. Furthermore the Kemper data should be implemented into the Data Lake of John Deere. For this a template was needed which was sent via FTP. Furthermore, the technical possibilities of Tableau were extended with the help of HyperAPI.
